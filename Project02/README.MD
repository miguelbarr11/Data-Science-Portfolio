## 1.- Forecasting Economic Indicators with ARIMA Models

*ARIMA*

ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model, which is a popular time series analysis technique used to forecast future values based on historical data. It combines three key components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) to create a model that can capture the patterns and trends in a time series.

ARIMA models have been widely used in predicting economic variables and stock prices due to their ability to capture both short-term and long-term patterns in data. The AR component captures the correlation between past and present values, the I component accounts for the trend or seasonality in the data, and the MA component captures the random noise or errors in the data. By combining these components, ARIMA models can provide accurate forecasts and help analysts make informed decisions in the financial industry.
