*Markowitz Portfolio Theory*

<div style="text-align: justify"> Markowitz's portfolio theory, also known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), is a mathematical framework for constructing portfolios that aim to maximize expected returns for a given level of risk. According to the theory, an investor should not only consider the expected return of individual assets, but also how they are related to each other in terms of their correlation and volatility. By diversifying investments across assets with low correlation, an investor can potentially reduce the overall risk of their portfolio without sacrificing expected returns. MPT is a cornerstone of modern finance and has revolutionized the way investors think about risk and return. </div>
